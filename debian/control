Description: Shared memory library - development files
 OSSP mm is a two layer abstraction library which simplifies the use of
 shared memory between forked (and therefore closely related) processes.
 It hides all platform-dependent aspects of the process from the user
 and provides a malloc(3)-style API.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to compile
 programs that use mm.
